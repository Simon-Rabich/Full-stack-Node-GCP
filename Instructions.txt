Assignment:

Please write your email here:    ____________________

In this assignment you will write a Node JS server that will  be deployed on an app engine (google cloud service) server.
The app engine project already exists for you to use, under the name: Test-Simon
This is the link to the project:

Please use vscode (already installed on your computer) to write the code.
Please use vscode terminal (using gcloud SDK - already installed on your computer) to deploy your code to the app engine project.
In the second part of the assignment you should write a google “Cloud function” that writes and reads data from the google cloud  “Datastore”.

Part 1: The server app:

The app should have 2 routes, each route should perform a different task.

Route a: “/aaa”: 
Should detect if the requesting client is a mobile phone or a different device (like a PC).
Should detect the OS of the requesting client.

Optional responses:
If the client is a PC then:
Response should return the OS of the client as a String.
If the client is not a PC then:
Response should return the response time of the server in milliseconds.

Route b: “/bbb”:
Should use “Cheerio” package to scrape an html web page, and return the result as a JSON to the client:
The page to be scrapped:
https://apps.apple.com/sz/app/happy-colour-by-numbers/id1407852246
The code should extract all script elements sources and image element sources from the page and return them in a JSON. (You can decide on a nice way to design the JSON structure).

Part 2: Cloud functions + Datastore: 

Use in this part VS-Code, VS-Code terminal, Google Cloud SDK (Do not use the google cloud function UI).
The function name should be: “function1”
The function should write or read data to/from “Datastore” DB.
The function should be able to receive a parameter in the query params
The parameter name should be: “write”
If “write=1”, then:
It should create kind, with a name: “kind-test”
In this kind, it should create an entity, with a name: “entity-test”
The entity should include 2 properties
String: with a name “String1”, and a value “String2”
Integer: with a name “Integer1” and a value “999”.
If “write=0”, then: 
The function should GET all entities information from the kind “kind-test” in the Datastore of the project.
The function should respond with a JSON that includes all the above data of the kind.
